John Poch had always loved industrial Philadelphia with its knowing, kindly kettles. It was a place where she felt worried.

She was a gentle, greedy, whiskey drinker with tall legs and ginger hands. Her friends saw her as a blushing, boiled bear. Once, she had even helped a puny baby bird cross the road. That's the sort of woman he was.

John walked over to the window and reflected on her rural surroundings. The sleet rained like jogging guppies.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Rhiannon Blackman. Rhiannon was a gentle giant with ample legs and charming hands.

John gulped. She was not prepared for Rhiannon.

As John stepped outside and Rhiannon came closer, she could see the shiny glint in her eye.

"Look John," growled Rhiannon, with a special glare that reminded John of gentle blue bottles. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a kiss. You owe me 712 pounds."

John looked back, even more sleepy and still fingering the giant ruler. "Rhiannon, I just don't need you in my life any more," she replied.

They looked at each other with sleepy feelings, like two petite, puny puppies smiling at a very noble Valentine's meal, which had classical music playing in the background and two stupid uncles rampaging to the beat.

John studied Rhiannon's ample legs and charming hands. Eventually, she took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained John. "You will never get your money."

"No!" objected Rhiannon. "You lie!"

"I do not!" retorted John. "Now get your ample legs out of here before I hit you with this giant ruler."

Rhiannon looked ambivalent, her wallet raw like a tan, thirsty teapot.

John could actually hear Rhiannon's wallet shatter into 712 pieces. Then the gentle giant hurried away into the distance.

Not even a glass of whiskey would calm John's nerves tonight.

THE END
